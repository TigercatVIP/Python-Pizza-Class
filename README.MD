Class Source Code:

This is simply a class that I create, to put on its atributes, by using self, this tributes are the Type, Price, Size of a Pizza
this self_atributes, will be use to define what will represent our class, then we can create an object, and this object call the cass (in this case the class name is "pizza1"
and then between the parenthesis we will define, every atribute of the class, in this case it's about the atributes of a pizza
then you can put the "type_of_pizza eg: vegetarian","the price eg: 5" and the size "size eg: small".

and then we can use the print function to print the object containing the type, the size, the price.. or simply all of them, in the "Main Source Code"
