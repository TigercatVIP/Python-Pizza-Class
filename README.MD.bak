Class Source Code:

This is simply a class that I create, to put on its atributes, by using self, this tributes are the Type, Price, Size of a Pizza
these self_atributes, will be use to define what will represent our class, and this object call the cass (in this case the class name is pizza 1
and then between parenthesis we will define, every atribute of the class, in this case it's about the atributes of a pizza
then you can put the "type_of_pizza eg: vegetarian","the price eg: 5" and the size "size eg: small".

and then we can use the print function to print the object containing the type, the size, the price.. or simply all of them, in the "Main Source Code"
